			<p style="color:plum;text-align:justify;"> <i> My name is Lina Montes. I have many interests that range from soccer, food, and dogs. I am also quite the netflix-enthusiast. I am a rising Senior at Yonkers Middle High School who hopes to attend college in NYC. I was born, grew up, and currently live in Yonkers, NY in Westchester County - apparently some of you refer to that as <q>upstate</q>. There is a lot to who I am. I am Colombian. I am a feminist. I am a dog owner. I am an athlete. I am a future coder. I am a foodie. I can not be me unless I am all of those things. In many ways, I see myself as an extremely versatile human.

			<h3 style="color:blueviolet; text-align:center;"> <big> <u> ATHLETE </u> </big> </h3>
			<p style="color:plum; text-align:justify; font-size: 15px;"> 
			I have been playing soccer for about <b> 8 YEARS </b>. I began playing soccer on Yonkers DPY Liverpool as the only girl in our whole Westchester League. After playing on that team for about 4 years, I decided to search for better opportunities with Westchester Soccer Club and began to play in the Premier League. Now, I currently am playing for NY Surf Soccer, an affiliate of the world-renowned Surf Soccer Club in San Diego, California. PLaying soccer has allowed me to travel across the country, make new memories, and connect with many colleges. I plan to pursue college soccer in the future.

			<p style="color:plum; text-align:justify; font-size: 15px;">
			I have a dog named Austin who is 3 years old. He is a mix between a german shepherd and a golden retriver. I adopted him for a rescue organization. When I adopted him, I realized he was really shy. He peed on me on the ride to his new home - our home. I was super excited nonetheless, and how could I be angry at my new, cute, fluffy best friend? Although he can't speak, I am aware of the hardships he encountered prior to being rescued. He does not like strangers at all and is extremely defensive of his "people" - which is terrible when I have friends come over.

			<p style="color:plum; text-align:justify; font-size: 15px;">
			<b>FOOD.</b> 
			I love food SO much. I am not a picky eater at all, and I believe that my open-mindedness allows me to try new foods whenever I go out. I think that food is a fascinating part of differeing cultures. Although food does not account for all that is a culture, learning where certain dishes come from and what they may mean is a good introduction towards eliminating ignorance. My love for food began as a young child in the streets of Colombia. I fell in love with empanadas, arepas, bandeja paisa's, bunuelos, and just about everything.

			<h3 style="color:blueviolet; text-align:center;"> <big> <u> GIRL </u> </big> </h3>
			<p style="color:plum; text-align:justify; font-size: 15px;">  
			As a girl, I know that my life experiences are extremely varied in comparison to my brothers. I am treated differenty by my teachers, parents, and coaches. Although my younger brother Joshua is 3 years younger than I am, the idea of him dating is celebrated, whereas it is prohibited with me. As a soccer player, I have often been told that because I am a girl, I can not be a good soccer player. Whenever I enter a park to play, I hear boys say <q> Take it easy, <b> she's a girl </b>. </q> Oh, are they wrong. As a daugther, there is extreme pressure to be <q><b>perfect </b></q>.
